# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Project
Project Description
Objective: Developed a machine learning model to
automate the detection of brain tumors in MRI scans,
aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, image
processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV), medical imaging
software (e.g., ITK), possibly cloud platforms for scalability.
